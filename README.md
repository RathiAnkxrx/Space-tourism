## The challenge

This is a multi page website for space tourism build with Html and Sass. By building this site the main focus is to learn Advance CSS (flex,grid) and SaSS so that it is completely responsive for any device width.

Users will be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information
